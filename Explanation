Write and test a class, Circle. The minimum required elements are shown below (Note: any unit type may be used).

Data Members:
• Radius, with an initial value of 10.

Methods:
• Constructor with no parameters. This is not the default constructor.
• Constructor that has one parameter, a double for radius.
• Getter method for radius
o The getter method must be used in your program solution.
• Setter method for radius
o The setter method must be used in your program solution.
• Method that computes and returns the area of a circle.
• Method that computes and returns the circumference of a circle.
• Method to display a circle’s radius, area, and circumference values.
o Restrict displaying all numeric outputs to two decimal places.
o Use meaningful output prompts for displaying the different outputs.

Testing:
• Develop a driver-class that implements the “main” method. Do not use “Main” as
the name of the driver-class.
• Use a meaningful name that represents the primary purpose of the class.
• The driver-class must only contain the “main” method.

The tasks below are to be implemented for testing the Circle class.
• Display the radius, area, and circumference of a circle based on the initial radius.
• Display the radius, area, and circumference based on a radius value provided by
the user.
• Change the radius value to 30, and then display the radius, area, and
circumference of the circle based on this radius value.
